## Overview

This project is divided into three parts:

1. **Dataset Generation**: Downloads snapshot files for both ILI and ARI, processes the data to compute revision metrics, and saves the results.
2. **Data Analysis**: Computes revision metrics and visualizes data revision patterns and their impact on forecasting accuracy.
3. **Forecasting Improvement**: Utilizes machine learning models to estimate data revisions and applies these estimates to enhance the performance of forecasting models.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

## File Structure

- **dataset_generation.py**: Handles data retrieval, processing, and saving.
- **data_analysis.py**: Performs data analysis, including visualization and revision estimation.
- **forecast_improvement.py**: Applies revision estimates to improve forecasting models.

## Usage
